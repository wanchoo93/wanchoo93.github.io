collection: publications
permalink: 
excerpt: 'We leverage the popular social media platform Reddit to analyze 1 million posts between January 6, 2019, to January 5, 2021, from 22 different communities (i.e., subreddits) that belong to four broader groupsâ€”diet, physical activity, substance use, and smoking. We identified that before the COVID-19 pandemic, posts involved sharing information about vacation, international travel, work, family, consumption of illicit substances, vaping, and alcohol, whereas during the pandemic, posts contained emotional content associated with quarantine, withdrawal symptoms, anxiety, attempts to quit smoking, cravings, weight loss, and physical fitness.'
