Teaching Assistant to Professor [Marc Miskin](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~mmiskin/) at the [Detkin Lab](https://detkin.ese.upenn.edu/) for the course ESE 112-001 2021A Eng Electromagnetics for Spring 2021.

Course Overview
======
The course was designed for the freshmen to be brought up to speed on how we understand electricity and magnetism, how the two interrelate, and their intimate connection to charge.  Students learned that both of these forces are just two aspects of the same thing, the electromagnetic field, and that the electromagnetic field is responsible for mediating the exchange of energy and momentum between charged objects. The course exhibited knowledge to help them find out that changing magnetic fields create electric fields and vice-versa, and that this exchange is responsible for the propagation of light.

My Contribution
======
Perform every experiment from the curriculim, record results as benchmarks for grading and guide students to execute the experiments smoothly in the lab.
