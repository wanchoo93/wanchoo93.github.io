I am currently a graduate student at University of Pennsylvania in the Electrical Engineering department pursuing research in NLP and Computer Vision. My ongoing Master's thesis in the Computer Science department at University of Pennsylvania is focused on leveraging natural language processing to study temporal shifts in language markers indicative of cardiovascular health behaviors (diet, smoking, drugs, physical activity) during public health events such as COVID-19. My research is being supervised by Professor [Lyle Ungar](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/) and Professor [Sharath Chandra Guntuku](https://sharathg.cis.upenn.edu/).

Prior to enrolling in the Master's program at Penn I had worked with several of world's leading Technology, Telecom, Retail and Manufacturing leaders, specializing in building analytical and machine learning solutions to help the clientele achieve their business goals smoothly. With five years of industry expertise working with multi million global businesses across USA, Latin-America, South-East Asia & Europe geographies my charter was to work closely with the client CXOs & BU leaders to help them create, incubate, launch & monetize successful investments in new digital technologies.

The Big Picture
------
In my ongoing research I aim to compare the health and lifestyle of people before and after the pandemic hit the world. This involves studying the impact of public events (Covid-19) on the behavioral, social, and environmental determinants of health with special focus on risks associated with cardio-vascular disease by leveraging diverse text data (Title of discussion, content of discussion and comments on discussion) available on different groups on Reddit (known as Subreddits).

Dual Objective
------
1. Uncover temporal shifts in language markers across 4 broad groups: (Drugs, Diet, Physical Activities & Smoking)
2. Analyze whether the pandemic motivated people to quit smoking, drugs and alcohol or financial and emotional stress resulted in an overdose

Research Interest
-----
I am interested in developing explainable deep learning solutions, in particular deep neural networks, natural language processing, robotics and computer vision. My ambition is to bring the dream of intelligent and autonomous systems closer to reality. Multi-disciplinary research.... study ideas from statistical physics, optimization, computer vision, control theory and motion-planning....Applications include the analysis of social media language and cell phone sensor data to better understand the drivers of physical and mental well-being...use the structure of language to help design computer vision systems, for example, Situation Recognition (demo), for modeling how objects are interacting in events using semantic roles. Sometimes, I like to work on pure NLP and I have recently released a new dataset for multi-turn information seeking dialogs from documents. With AI systems getting better and being more broadly applied, its important to think about how the models might treat people, in similar circumstances, differently.
