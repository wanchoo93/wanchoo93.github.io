I am currently a graduate student at University of Pennsylvania in the Electrical Engineering department pursuing research in NLP and Computer Vision. My ongoing Master's thesis in the Computer Science department at University of Pennsylvania is focused on leveraging natural language processing to study temporal shifts in language markers indicative of cardiovascular health behaviors (diet, smoking, drugs, physical activity) during public health events such as COVID-19. My research is being supervised by Professor [Lyle Ungar](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/) and Professor [Sharath Chandra Guntuku](https://sharathg.cis.upenn.edu/). Professor [Lyle Ungar's](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/) research group develops explainable machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing methods for psychology and medical research.

Prior to enrolling in the Master's program at Penn I had worked with several of world's leading Technology, Telecom, Retail and Manufacturing leaders, specializing in building analytical and machine learning solutions to help the clientele achieve their business goals smoothly. With five years of industry expertise working with multi million global businesses across USA, Latin-America, South-East Asia & Europe geographies my charter was to work closely with the client CXOs & BU leaders to help them create, incubate, launch & monetize successful investments in new digital technologies.

Research Interest
-----
I am interested in developing explainable deep learning solutions, in particular natural language processing, robotics and computer vision. My ambition is to bring the dream of intelligent and autonomous systems closer to reality by leveraging multi-disciplinary research to study ideas from statistical physics, optimization, computer vision, control theory and motion-planning.

I am intrigued by those challenging research problems whose applications revolve around physical and mental well-being of the society. In my ongoing masterâ€™s thesis I aim to compare the health and lifestyle of people before and after the pandemic hit the world with special focus on risks associated with cardio-vascular disease using Natural Language Processing. More details about my ongoing Master's Thesis can be found [here](https://wanchoo93.github.io/teaching/2016-spring-teaching-3).

I would love to develop systems that belong at the intersection of natural language and computer vision. For instance, creating a framework that can intelligently comprehend and interpret the driving environment visuals, recognize hazardous or abnormal scene and forecast the outcome in order to respond with utmost efficiency. This is equivalent to envisioning a smart machine utilizing image recognition and semantics to prevent locomotive crashes in real time.
