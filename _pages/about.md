I am currently a graduate student at University of Pennsylvania in the Electrical Engineering department pursuing research in NLP and Computer Vision. My ongoing Master's thesis in the Computer Science department at University of Pennsylvania is focused on leveraging natural language processing to study temporal shifts in language markers indicative of cardiovascular health behaviors (diet, smoking, drugs, physical activity) during public health events such as COVID-19. My research is being supervised by Professor [Lyle Ungar](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/) and Professor [Sharath Chandra Guntuku](https://sharathg.cis.upenn.edu/). Professor [Lyle Ungar's](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/) research group develops explainable machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing methods for psychology and medical research.

Prior to enrolling in the Master's program at Penn I had worked with several of world's leading Technology, Telecom, Retail and Manufacturing leaders, specializing in building analytical and machine learning solutions to help the clientele achieve their business goals smoothly. With five years of industry expertise working with multi million global businesses across USA, Latin-America, South-East Asia & Europe geographies my charter was to work closely with the client CXOs & BU leaders to help them create, incubate, launch & monetize successful investments in new digital technologies.

Research Interest
-----
I am interested in developing explainable deep learning solutions, in particular deep neural networks, natural language processing, robotics and computer vision. My ambition is to bring the dream of intelligent and autonomous systems closer to reality. Multi-disciplinary research.... study ideas from statistical physics, optimization, computer vision, control theory and motion-planning....Applications include the analysis of social media language and cell phone sensor data to better understand the drivers of physical and mental well-being...use the structure of language to help design computer vision systems, for example, Situation Recognition (demo), for modeling how objects are interacting in events using semantic roles. Sometimes, I like to work on pure NLP and I have recently released a new dataset for multi-turn information seeking dialogs from documents. With AI systems getting better and being more broadly applied, its important to think about how the models might treat people, in similar circumstances, differently.

There is more about my ongoing Master's Thesis [here]().
